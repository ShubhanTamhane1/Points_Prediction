# 🏀 NBA Player Points Prediction 
  
The goal of this project is to use **linear regression** to predict the points scored by an NBA player in a game using **Python**. The project focuses on building a reliable regression model and thoroughly testing all assumptions, such as **linearity**, **homoscedasticity**, and **normality**. The project aims to assist analysts, coaches, fantasy players and fans by providing an accurate representation of a player’s performance. 

## 📌 Features 
- Preprocessing of NBA player performance datasets
- Includes **EDA** to understand relationships between features
- Testing of assumptions required for analysis in Linear Regression
- Uses **Linear Regression** to predict NBA players points
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error and R² Score**

## 📡 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language: Python** 
- Libraries and Tools: 
  - Pandas 
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Sklearn
  - SciPy
  - Statsmodels
  - Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes NBA player performance statistics, such as:
- Predictor: Field Goals Made
- Target: Points Scored

## 📊 Results: 
- **R²  Score **: 98.8%
- MSE: 2929.35
  
**Key Insights**: Players who made more field goals scored more points, with some variation explained by other factors such as three pointers, free throws, or normal field goals.
